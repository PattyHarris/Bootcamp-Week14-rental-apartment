# Rental Apartment Website

This week's project is to create a website similar to AirBnb. Some changes for this week include:

1. There is no authentication added to the project - e.g. no dashboard
2. This is more of a front-end application

## Initial Setup

1. Initial setup of Next.js is the same as prior weeks. The completed project for reference is here: https://github.com/flaviocopes/bootcamp-2022-week-14-rental-apartment
2. Setup Prisma as before.
3. Since we're not using NextAuth.js, we need to separately install the prisma client.

```
npm install @prisma/client
```
